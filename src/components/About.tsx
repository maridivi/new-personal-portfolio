      Hi there! I'm <strong>Marianna</strong>, a self-taught web developer with
      a love for building nice apps and websites.<br></br>

      In my free time, you'll find me in the gym, lifting weights and striving
      for personal growth both physically and mentally.<br></br>
      <br></br>I also enjoy reading historical fiction, as well as watching high
